      <p>I am aspiring Engineer.</p>
      <p style={{marginTop: "50px", fontSize: 14, padding: "50px", textAlign: "justify", lineHeight: "2em"}}>Being a young space enthusiast, space has always been my passion. I have dedicated the past 7 years of my life to this, and I have always imagined being an Astronaut and contributing to humankind by conducting research in space to support extraterrestrial life beyond earth. I have also been advocating for drafting space law and policy and the establishment of the National Space Agency in our country. I have been showing passion for space exploration and planetary science in various possible ways. I was the first National Coordinator for NASA Scientist for a Day in Nepal. I guided students from 5-12 grades to research planets and their moons. Recently, I was appointed as a Committee Member of the IAA/IAF/IISL Advisory Committee on History Activities(ACHA) at the International Astronautical Federation and Nation Coordinator for Astronomers without Borders of Nepal. Besides this, I am International Astronomical Unionâ€™s Dark Skies Ambassador, STEM Ambassador for East-West Center Nepal, and Student Space Ambassador for The Mars Generation for Nepal. I am an active member of SGAC and a mentor as well. I am also working as a program committee co-lead at the Nepalese Space Research Association (NESRA). I have been immensely dedicating my passion to the space industry in Nepal for all these years, and my main aim is to change Nepal from a non-space-faring nation to a space-faring country. 
So, In a nutshell, space for me is everything. I have organized, researched, and taken leadership in this field many times for the upliftment, research, and sustainability of space and to enhance human life through its applications.
